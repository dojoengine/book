# Dojo: The Provable Game Engine

## Simplifying Onchain App Development

Dojo is an [open source](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo) framework designed to make building **provable** and onchain games easy. Whether you're creating games or other blockchain and zero-knowledge applications, Dojo has you covered. While it excels in game development, it's versatile enough to handle a wide range of onchain applications.

### Get Your Onchain App Up and Running in 3 Easy Steps:

1. **Define** your onchain state using simple, database-like models.
2. **Query** your state effortlessly with automatically generated GraphQL or gRPC.
3. **Deploy** your app with ease.

With Dojo, you can skip the hassle of writing complex indexers, managing intricate contract patterns, or setting up detailed query systems. Focus on bringing your ideas to life quickly and efficiently.

## What's Included?

**Dojo** streamlines the development of provable and onchain applications, making it easier to deploy and verify them on blockchains. It offers a straightforward way to define applications using [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/) and provides a comprehensive toolset for building, deploying, and managing your projects.

### Dojo Comes with:

- **Cairo Framework**: A collection of contracts and protocols for creating applications that are provable, extensible, and easy to build upon.
- **Katana (sequencer)**: A high-performance sequencer that's both modular and expandable.
- **Torii (indexer)**: An indexer that automatically generates GraphQL and gRPC APIs for real-time state updates.
- **Sozo (cli)**: A cli tool for planning and managing smart contract deployments, upgrades, and maintenance.

Additionally, [Cartridge](https://cartridge.gg) offers tools and services to help you take your provable applications to production:

- **Slot**: A managed service that lets you deploy and scale your provable applications quickly and easily.

> **Note:** If you're new to Cairo, we recommend [learning Cairo](https://book.cairo-lang.org) before diving into the Dojo guide.
