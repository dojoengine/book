# Building Games on Starknet: The Complete Stack

::authors

Building a game on Starknet isn't just about writing Cairo. You need a full stack: an execution environment, state management, client synchronization, and player onboarding. Here's how the pieces fit together.

## The Challenge

Traditional game development has decades of tooling. Engines like Unity and Unreal handle rendering, physics, networking, and asset management out of the box.

Onchain games are different. The blockchain is your backend, but you still need:
- A way to model game state
- Fast, cheap execution for player actions
- Clients that stay in sync with onchain state
- Wallets that don't interrupt gameplay

Dojo solves this by providing a complete framework purpose-built for onchain games.

## Layer 1: The Framework

Dojo brings familiar game development patterns to Cairo:

**Entity Component System (ECS)**

Games think in entities (players, items, tiles) and components (position, health, inventory). Dojo's ECS maps directly to onchain storage while generating typed clients automatically.

```cairo
#[derive(Component)]
struct Position {
    x: u32,
    y: u32,
}

#[derive(Component)]
struct Health {
    current: u32,
    max: u32,
}
```

**World Contract**

Every Dojo game deploys a World contract that manages all state. Systems (your game logic) read and write through the World, keeping everything consistent.

**Typed Clients**

Dojo generates TypeScript and Unity clients from your contracts. No manual ABI parsing. State updates flow automatically from chain to client.

## Layer 2: Execution

Games can't run on Starknet mainnet directly — transaction costs and latency would kill the experience. Instead, games run on dedicated execution layers.

[Cartridge Slot](https://cartridge.gg) provides application-specific rollups for Dojo games:
- Sub-second transaction finality
- Negligible costs per action
- Full Starknet compatibility
- Proofs that settle back to L1

This means your game logic executes fast and cheap while inheriting Starknet's security guarantees.

## Layer 3: Indexing

Onchain state is authoritative but slow to query. Torii, Dojo's indexer, maintains a synchronized database of your World state.

Your client queries Torii for fast reads while writes go directly to the chain. When state changes onchain, Torii updates and pushes to connected clients via GraphQL subscriptions.

```typescript
// Subscribe to position changes
const positions = await client.getEntities({
  model: "Position",
  where: { player_id: playerId }
});
```

## Layer 4: Player Identity

The final piece is onboarding. Players shouldn't need to understand gas, transactions, or seed phrases.

[Cartridge Controller](https://cartridge.gg) handles this:
- Email/social login that creates a Starknet account
- Session keys for seamless gameplay (no popups per action)
- Account abstraction for gas sponsorship
- Cross-game identity and inventory

From the player's perspective, they're just logging into a game. The blockchain complexity is invisible.

## Putting It Together

Here's the full stack for a Dojo game:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Game Client (React/Unity)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Cartridge Controller (Identity + Wallet)│
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Torii (Indexer + Subscriptions)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Cartridge Slot (Execution Layer) │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│      Dojo World Contract (Game Logic)    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              Starknet (Settlement)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer handles a specific concern. Developers focus on game design while the infrastructure handles the hard parts.

## Getting Started

The fastest path to a running game:

1. **Install Dojo**: `curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash`
2. **Scaffold a project**: `sozo init my-game`
3. **Deploy locally**: `katana` for a local devnet, then `sozo build && sozo migrate`
4. **Generate client**: Dojo outputs TypeScript bindings automatically

From zero to playable prototype in an afternoon.

## What's Next

The stack keeps improving. Faster provers mean quicker settlement. Better indexers mean richer queries. More client SDKs mean more platforms.

Games shipping today on Dojo — like [Eternum](https://realms.world), [Loot Survivor](https://lootsurvivor.io), and others in the [Cartridge ecosystem](https://cartridge.gg) — are stress-testing this infrastructure and pushing it forward.

The goal: make building onchain games as straightforward as building traditional ones, while preserving everything that makes them special.
