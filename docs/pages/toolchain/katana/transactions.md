## Supported Transaction Types

Katana aims to follow the Starknet specifications as closely as possible, and mimics the features that is currently supported on the mainnet. As such, Katana currently supports the following Starknet transaction types:

| Type           | Version |
| -------------- | ------- |
| INVOKE         | 1, 3    |
| DECLARE        | 1, 2, 3 |
| DEPLOY_ACCOUNT | 1, 3    |

To learn more about the different transaction types, you can refer to the [Starknet documentation](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/framework_and_concepts/Network_Architecture/transactions).
