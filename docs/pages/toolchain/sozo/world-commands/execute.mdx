## sozo execute

`execute` is used to execute a World's system.

Performing a system execution requires sending a transaction, therefore, `execute` expects an account address as well as its respective private key in order to sign the transaction before sending it.

As `sozo` has access to the manifests generated at compile time, you can provide either the name of the contract or its address to execute a system.

### USAGE

```sh
# you can use the name or address of the contract
sozo execute <CONTRACT> <ENTRYPOINT>
```

##### Arguments

_`CONTRACT`_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fully qualified name of the contract or it's address.

_`ENTRYPOINT`_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the system to be executed.

### OPTIONS

#### General Options

`--calldata [-c]` _CALLDATA_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calldata to be passed to the system that you want to execute.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comma separated values e.g., 0x12345,0x69420.
