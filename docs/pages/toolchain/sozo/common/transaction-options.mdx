`--fee-estimate-multiplier` _MULTIPLIER_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multiplier to use for the fee estimate. This value will be used on the estimated fee which will be used as the max fee for the transaction (max_fee = estimated_fee * multiplier).

`--wait [-w]`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait until the transaction is accepted by the sequencer, returning the status and the hash. This will poll the transaction status until it gets accepted or rejected by the sequencer.

`--receipt [-r]`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If `--wait` is set, returns the full transaction receipt. Otherwise, it does nothing.
