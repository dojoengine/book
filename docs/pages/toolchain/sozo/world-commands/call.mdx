## sozo call

`call` is used to call a World's system.

Performing a call on a system is not sending any transaction, but may contain a return value (at the differences of transactions that do not return any value directly).

You don't need to provide an account address or private key, as you are not signing any transaction.

### USAGE

```sh
# you can use the name or address of the contract
sozo call <CONTRACT> <ENTRYPOINT>
```

##### Arguments

_`CONTRACT`_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fully qualified name of the contract or it's address.

_`ENTRYPOINT`_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the system to be executed.

### OPTIONS
