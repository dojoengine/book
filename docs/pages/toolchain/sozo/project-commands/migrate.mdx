## sozo migrate

`migrate` is used to perform the migration (deployment) process, declaring and deploying contracts as necessary to deploy or update the World.

Changes made to the local World after the initial deployment, can easily be pushed to the remote counterpart by running `sozo migrate [SUB-COMMAND] --world <WORLD_ADDRESS>` with `WORLD_ADDRESS` being the address of the remote World. In the background, `migrate` will compute the diffs of the local and remote World, then, start constructing a migration strategy to determine, if any, which part of the local World needs to be pushed upstream.

The `migrate` command has two subcommands: `plan` and `apply`.
* `plan`: With this subcommand nothing is send on-chain. `sozo` retrieves the remote world and computes the diffs between the remote world and the local world. It outputs the manifests files into the `manifests/<profile_name>/deployments` folder and the two manifest files `manifests/<profile_name>/manifest.[json,toml]`.
* `apply`: This subcommand will apply the diffs on the remote world and update the manifests files to contain the on-chain data like transaction hash, block number, etc.

__Note__: You can directly run `sozo migrate apply` without the need of running `sozo migrate plan`. You should run `sozo migrate plan` if you want to generate the manifests file only and do a dry run without sending transactions to the chain.

### USAGE

```sh
Usage: sozo migrate [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  plan   Plan the migration and output the manifests.
  apply  Apply the migration on-chain.
  help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

### OPTIONS

#### General Options

`--name` _NAME_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name of the World. At the moment, the only usage for this option is to be used as a salt when deploying the World contract to avoid address conflicts. This option is **required** when performing the initial migration of the World.

#### World Options

<WorldOptions/>

#### Starknet Options

<StarknetOptions/>

#### Account Options

<AccountOptions/>

#### Signer Options - Raw

<SignerOptionsRaw/>

#### Signer Options - Keystore

<SignerOptionsKeystore/>

### EXAMPLES

1. Deploying your World for the first time to a local Katana node

```sh
sozo migrate apply --name ohayo --rpc-url http://localhost:5050
```

2. Updating a remote World after making some changes

```sh
sozo migrate apply --world 0x123456
```

3. Deploying your World using [profile options](../common-options/profile.md), where configuration like `rpc-url` are set in the profile.

```sh
sozo --profile my_profile migrate apply
```
