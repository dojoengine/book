## sozo execute

`execute` is used to execute a World's system.

Performing a system execution requires sending a transaction, therefore, `execute` expects an account address as well as its respective private key in order to sign the transaction before sending it.

As `sozo` has access to the manifests generated at compile time, you can provide either the name of the contract or its address to execute a system.

### USAGE

```sh
# Multicall is supported so you can batch several calls.
# Call format: <CONTRACT>,<ENTRYPOINT>[,<CALLDATA>]

sozo execute <CALL_1> ... <CALL_N>
```

##### Arguments

_`CONTRACT`_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tag of the contract (dojo-Actions for example) or its address.

_`ENTRYPOINT`_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the system to be executed.

_`CALLDATA`_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _(optional)_ The calldata to be passed to the system that you want to execute. Comma separated values e.g., 0x12345,0x69420.

Sozo supports some prefixes that you can use to automatically parse some types.\
The supported prefixes are:
- `u256`: A 256-bit unsigned integer.
- `sstr`: A cairo short string.
- `str`: A cairo string (ByteArray).
- `int`: A signed integer.
- no prefix: A cairo felt or any type that fit into one felt.
