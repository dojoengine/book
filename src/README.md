## Dojo: The Provable Game Engine

Dojo employs [Cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo) to deliver a robust architecture and toolset for designing autonomous worlds and onchain games. It features an integrated entity component system (ECS) and includes a native indexer, RPC testnet, and a comprehensive CLI management toolkit.

This book is dedicated to familiarizing you with the Dojo engine and the potential of Provable games. A special section on the [Theory](./theory/autonomous-worlds.md) elucidates this emergent concept of autonomous worlds and Provable games.
