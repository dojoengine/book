# Getting Started

Using dojo.js client side is pretty easy. We have your back with those two methods:

## Senpai mode (easiest)

Use this if you want a seamless easy and fast experience to access your contracts.

::::steps

### Init dojo

This will provide you with a list of templates to choose from which all have the necessary configuration to get started with dojo.js.

```sh
pnpx @dojoengine/create-dojo start
```

#### Recommended Setup - Using the SDK with React

This will provide you with a starter template for building a React application using the Dojo SDK.

```bash
npx @dojoengine/create-dojo start -t example-vite-react-sdk
```

Read about the offical SDK [here](/client/sdk/javascript/overview).

#### Advanced Setup - Using the SDK with RECS

This will provide you with a starter template for building a React application using the Dojo SDK and RECS state management.

```bash
npx @dojoengine/create-dojo start -t example-vite-react-app-recs
```

### Install

```sh
cd {project_name}
pnpm i
```

::::

## Sensei mode (more flexible)

Use this if you want to have full control of the structure of your project.

::::steps

### Create a project

You can use any library, all you need is to use a package manager. We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).
Think of dojo.js as a thin wrapper around [dojo.c](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo.c) that is a wasm library to expose client features in wasm.

### Installing dojo.js stack

```sh
cd {project_name}
pnpm add @dojoengine/core @dojoengine/sdk @dojoengine/torii-client
```

### Setup dojo

Once you have the required libraries installed, you will need to scaffold some files.

- dojo.config.ts (tells dojo.js where your manifest are located)
- models and contracts (those will be generated with sozo)

#### dojoConfig.ts

```ts filename="./src/dojo/dojoConfig.ts"
import { createDojoConfig } from "@dojoengine/core";

import manifest from "../path/to/your/contracts/manifest_dev.json";

export const dojoConfig = createDojoConfig({
    manifest,
});
```

#### Generate models and contracts

```sh
DOJO_MANIFEST_PATH="../relative/path/to/Scarb.toml" sozo build --typescript --bindings-output ./src/dojo/
```

### Mapping dojo to your framework

When your code is setup and generated, you can now start binding dojo to your UI

```ts filename="./src/dojo/init.ts"
import { init } from "@dojoengine/sdk";
// ModelNameInteface is exported from ./models.generated.ts
// This file contains mapping of your cairo contracts to torii client
import { ModelNameInterface, schema } from "./models.generated.ts";
import { env, getRpcUrl } from "@/env";
import { dojoConfig } from "./dojoConfig";

const db = await init<ModelNameInterface>(
    {
        client: {
            // This is local katana
            rpcUrl: "http://localhost:5050",
            // This is local torii
            toriiUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
            relayUrl: "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9090/tcp/80",
            worldAddress: dojoConfig.manifest.world.address,
        },
        // Those values are used
        domain: {
            name: "MyDojoProject",
            revision: "vx.x.x",
            chainId: "vx.x.x",
            version: "vx.x.x",
        },
    },
    schema
);
```

#### Important note

The previous function must be called once to avoid creating wasm grpc clients over and over.
We suggest you to call it in your main.ts file and give this to your component tree as a dependency

Example using react and vite :

```ts filename="./src/main.ts"

export const DojoContext = createContext<SDK<ModelNameInterface> | null>(
    null
);

async function main() {
  // Function init defined above
    const db = await init<ModelNameInterface>(...);

    createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
        <StrictMode>
            <DojoContext.Provider value={db}>
                <RootLayout>
                    <Home />
                </RootLayout>
            </DojoContext.Provider>
        </StrictMode>
    );
}

main();
```

## Run the app

To run the app locally, you need to have your world deployed. Follow those steps to make this work.

::::steps

### Run katana

```bash
katana --dev --dev.no-fee --http.cors_origins '*'
```

### Migrate the world

In your contract folder

```bash
sozo migrate
```

### Run torii

```bash
torii -w {world_address-output of previous command} --http.cors_origins '*'
```
