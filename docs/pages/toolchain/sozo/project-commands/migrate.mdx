## sozo migrate

The `migrate` command handles the deployment and updating process for your World, including contract declaration and deployment. It automatically manages the migration of your local World changes to remote environments.

## World Address Configuration

To update an existing World, configure the world address in your profile configuration (e.g., `dojo_dev.toml`):

```toml
[env]
world_address = "0x06171ed98331e849d6084bf2b3e3186a7ddf35574dd68cab4691053ee8ab69d7"
```

When sozo migrate is executed, it:

1. Detects the world_address from your profile configuration
2. Compares local and remote World states
3. Generates migration strategy
4. Deploys necessary updates upstream
