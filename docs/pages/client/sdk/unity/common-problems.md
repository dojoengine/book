# Common problems and solutions

## Model Bindings

When modifying the bindings generated by Dojo, ensure that all fields in the model bindings are declared as public.

> ⚠️ Failing to do so can result in the values of the fields not being loaded properly.

For example:

```cs
public class RoomHero : ModelInstance {
    [ModelField("room_id")]
    private uint room_id; ❌
}
```

```cs
public class RoomHero : ModelInstance {
    [ModelField("room_id")]
    public uint room_id; ✅
}
```

> By declaring fields as `public`, you ensure proper loading and access to the values within the model bindings.

## Slot on Desktop

Currently, Slot functionality is not available on desktop platforms due to a server error preventing the initialization of the ToriiClient within the WorldManager component. This results in the following exception:

```cs
Exception: status: Unknown, message: "h2 protocol error: http2 error: connection error detected: frame with invalid size", details: [], metadata: MetadataMap { headers: {} }
Dojo.Torii.ToriiClient..ctor (System.String toriiUrl, System.String rpcUrl, System.String world, dojo_bindings.dojo+KeysClause[] entities) (at Assets/Dojo/Runtime/Torii/ToriiClient.cs:40)
Dojo.WorldManager.Start () (at Assets/Dojo/Runtime/WorldManager.cs:28)
```

💡 If you intend to use Slot, you must build the game for WebGL platform instead.

## WebGL Build Errors

Encountering the following error during a WebGL build?
![webgl-error](/unity/webgl-error.png)

Here are the steps to address it:

1. **Verify Dojo Template Selection**:
    - Navigate to `Edit > Project Settings > Player` (or directly through the Project Settings window).
    ![webgl-error](/unity/webgl-build-fail.png)
    > Example without `Dojo` template selected
    - Select the WebGL tab.
    - Under `Resolution and Presentation`, ensure the `Dojo` Template is selected.
    - If the Dojo template is missing, proceed to `step 2`.

2. **Download WebGL Templates Folder**: If the Dojo template is unavailable in Player Settings, it's likely missing from your project.
    - Navigate to the [Dojo Unity repository](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo.unity)
    - Download the `WebGL templates` folder.
    - Add this folder to your project's Assets directory.

3. **Rebuild Your Project**:
After ensuring the Dojo template is selected or added, try rebuilding your project for WebGL.

## Async calls not Working

If asynchronous calls to the Dojo systems are not functioning as expected, ensure that the `UnityMainThreadDispatcher` is present in your scene.

```cs
return await account.ExecuteRaw(new dojo.Call[] {
            new dojo.Call{...}
            }
```

If you don't have it, add it to your scene. 

> The `UnityMainThreadDispatcher` can be found in `Assets/Dojo/Runtime directory`.

## Bingen plugin error

When executing the command

```rust
Sozo build --unity
```

to generate the bingens for your Unity project, you might encounter the following error:

```bash
thread 'main' panicked at crates/dojo-bindgen/src/plugins/unity/mod.rs:188:50:
called Result::unwrap() on an Err value: ConversionFailed("Can't convert token into composite, got CoreBasic(CoreBasic { type_path: \"core::starknet::contract_address::ContractAddress\" })")
note: run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display a backtrace
```

> To resolve this issue, it's recommended to upgrade your Dojo version to at least `v0.6.0-alpha`. You can achieve this by running the following command in your terminal:

```rust
dojoup --version v0.6.0-alpha
```

## Torii Communication Error

Encountering the following error when running your Unity program?

```bash
Exception: transport error
Dojo.Torii.ToriiClient..ctor (System.String toriiUrl, System.String rpcUrl, System.String relayUrl, System.String world) (at Assets/Dojo/Runtime/Torii/ToriiClient.cs:33)
Dojo.WorldManager.Awake () (at Assets/Dojo/Runtime/WorldManager.cs:25)
System.Runtime.CompilerServices.AsyncMethodBuilderCore+<>c.<ThrowAsync>b__7_0 (System.Object state) (at <2ccb053bed3740ab940e67afec38ab31>:0)
UnityEngine.UnitySynchronizationContext+WorkRequest.Invoke () (at /Users/bokken/build/output/unity/unity/Runtime/Export/Scripting/UnitySynchronizationContext.cs:153)
UnityEngine.UnitySynchronizationContext.Exec () (at /Users/bokken/build/output/unity/unity/Runtime/Export/Scripting/UnitySynchronizationContext.cs:83)
UnityEngine.UnitySynchronizationContext.ExecuteTasks () (at /Users/bokken/build/output/unity/unity/Runtime/Export/Scripting/UnitySynchronizationContext.cs:107)
```

This error message indicates that your Unity program cannot establish communication with the `Torii server`.

Troubleshooting Steps:

1. Verify Torii URL: Double-check the Torii URL configured in your Unity project settings.
2. Confirm Torii Status: Make sure the Torii server is up and running.

## Authentication Error During Transaction Execution

While executing a transaction from your Unity project, you encounter the following error in the Katana terminal:

```bash
2024-03-19T18:05:46.841197Z  WARN executor: Transaction execution error: "Error in the called contract (0x00280a3deba2004bbbdb3d60a619f3059305f2399ab1e1cd630ec20249abe5fa):

> 💡Solution:

- **Execute default_auth.sh**: Navigate to the `src` directory within your Dojo project. Run the script `default_auth`.sh using your terminal.
