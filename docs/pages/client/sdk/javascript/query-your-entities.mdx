# Query your entities

## Using the QueryBuilder

The QueryBuilder provides a fluent interface to construct queries for your entities. It allows you to organize your queries by namespace and entity, making it easy to build complex queries in a type-safe manner.

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the QueryBuilder:

```typescript
const query = new QueryBuilder()
    .namespace("world", (n) =>
        n.entity("player", (e) => e.eq("id", "1").eq("name", "Alice"))
    )
    .build();
```

### Structure

The QueryBuilder follows a hierarchical structure:

1. Namespaces - logical groupings for your entities
2. Entities - the specific types you want to query
3. Conditions - the filters you want to apply

### Query Operators

Currently supported operators:

- `is()` - Strict equality comparison
- `eq()` - Equality comparison
- `neq()` - Not equal comparison
- `gt()` - Greater than comparison
- `gte()` - Greater than or equal comparison
- `lt()` - Less than comparison
- `lte()` - Less than or equal comparison

### Complete Example

Here's a more complex example showing multiple namespaces and entities:

```typescript
const query = new QueryBuilder()
    .namespace("world", (n) =>
        n.entity("player", (e) => e.eq("id", "1").eq("name", "Alice"))
    )
    .namespace("universe", (n) =>
        n.entity("galaxy", (e) => e.is("name", "Milky Way"))
    )
    .build();
```

This will generate a query object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  world: {
    player: {
      $: {
        where: {
          id: { $eq: "1" },
          name: { $eq: "Alice" }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  universe: {
    galaxy: {
      $: {
        where: {
          name: { $is: "Milky Way" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Best Practices

1. Always chain your queries using the fluent interface
2. Group related entities under the same namespace
3. Use the appropriate operator for your comparisons (`eq` vs `is`)
4. Call `build()` at the end of your query to generate the final query object

### Type Safety

The QueryBuilder is designed to be type-safe, helping you catch potential errors at compile time when using TypeScript.
