"build an onchain game appreciates the inherent engineering hurdles - a "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The precise definition of Autonomous Worlds (AWs) remains somewhat elusive, "
"as it is more of an abstract concept that has yet to be fully crystallized. "
"Lattice first [introduced](https://0xparc.org/blog/autonomous-worlds) the "
"terminology in 2022, but the notion of open worlds operating on the "
"blockchain has been around for a while. The abstraction introduced by MUD "

"Autonomous Worlds share notable similarities with blockchains in their "
"fundamental nature. Once established, they persist, maintaining their state "
"throughout the lifespan of the chain. Players can join or leave, and "
"developers can expand these worlds by deploying features in a permissionless "
"manner, much like how contracts are added to a chain. While there is no "
"universally accepted definition for an Autonomous World, we believe that a "
"game must possess at least the following two essential features to be "
"considered as such:"
msgstr ""

#: src/theory/autonomous-worlds.md:9
msgid ""
"1. Decentralized data availability layer: While the state execution may "
"reside on a centralized layer, it is crucial that the state can be "
"reconstructed if the execution layer ceases to exist. Rollups offer a "
"solution, providing increased capacity execution layers while ensuring data "
"is permanently settled on Ethereum. This guarantees the world's perpetual "
"persistence.\n"
"\n"
"2. Permissionless entry point for expanding the world: The World contract "
"must be capable of accepting new systems and components without requiring "
"permission. While this doesn't imply that every component and system will be "
"utilized, they must adhere to this pattern, ensuring open and unrestricted "
"access for potential enhancements."

"innovation, eventually questioning the very notion of \"play\" in this brave "

"Dojo employs the ECS (Entity Component System) as an architectural pattern "
"to efficiently manage and organize the state and behavior of Autonomous "
"Worlds (AWs). In this pattern, computation is defined as a list of systems "
"operating on a set of entities, each of which consists of a dynamic set of "
"pure data components. Systems select the entities to process via persistent "
