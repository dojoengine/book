### Quickstart with React

Concise. Get started with Dojo in minutes.

This assumes knowledge of React and the Dojo CLI.

Prerequisites:

-   [Dojo CLI installed](/getting-started/setup.md)

1. Create project

```bash
npx @dojoengine/create-dojo start -t example-vite-react-sdk
```

2. Setup client

```bash
cd client
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to view the project. It will not be connected to the network yet.

3. Setup contracts

```bash
# In contracts directory
sozo build

# In new terminal
katana --disable-fee --allowed-origins "*"
```

4. Connect to the development network and indexer

```bash
# In new terminal
sozo migrate apply
```

5. Return to the client and refresh the page. You should now see the project connected to the network and indexed!
