## Quick Start

> It is worth reading [theory](/theory/autonomous-worlds.md) to familiarize yourself with the concept of Autonomous Worlds (AWs) and the [Cairo ecosystem](/theory/cairo.md) before diving into the code.

::::steps

### Install Dojoup

Dojo is built around a set of development tools - Katana, Torii and Sozo. Install them all easily with Dojoup.

```sh
curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash
```

### Run dojoup

This will install Dojoup, then simply follow the instructions on-screen,
which will make the `dojoup` command available in your CLI.

```sh
dojoup
```

For full `dojoup` reference and debugging see [Dojoup](/toolchain/dojoup.md).

### Install scarb (optional)

For the language server to work properly, your local Scarb version should not be lower than Dojo's cairo version. To accomplish this, install it with the following command:

```sh
# todo: input command here
```
