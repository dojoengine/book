# Getting Started

This section guides you through:

- Dojo Unity SDK Setup: Learn how to integrate the Dojo.unity SDK into your Unity scene for seamless development.
- Calling Dojo Systems: Discover how to interact with various systems within your Dojo world directly from Unity.
- Building for Desktop & WebGL: Master the steps for building your onchain game for both desktop and WebGL platforms(using the Slot framework).

## Setting up Unity Scene

::::steps

### Add Essential Prefabs

In your Unity project, navigate to the scene where you want to integrate the Dojo SDK.

- From the `Project` window, locate the `Assets/Dojo/Prefabs` folder.
  Drag the `WorldManager` prefab into your scene. This prefab acts as the central hub for managing entities in your Dojo world.
- Additionally, navigate to the `Assets/Dojo/Runtime` folder and drag the `UnityMainThreadDispatcher` prefab into your scene.

### Configuring the World Manager

Here's how to tailor the World Manager's settings to your specific needs:

#### Default Configuration

The World Manager operates with a default configuration called `WorldManagerDataLocalConfig`, residing in `Dojo/Runtime/Config`.

![world-manager-data](/unity/world-manager-data.png)
Feel free to modify this configuration directly if it suits your project's requirements.

#### Creating Custom Configurations

To create separate configuration files for different environments (like Slot), follow these simple steps:

In the `Project` window, right-click and choose `Create > ScriptableObjects > WorldManagerData`.
Customize the configuration values within this new ScriptableObject instance.

#### Applying a Configuration

To use a specific configuration, locate the `WorldManager` game object in your scene.
Drag the desired ScriptableObject (either the default one or your custom configuration) onto the `DojoConfig` field within the `WorldManager` component.

### Adding Binding Models

- Generate Models: If you haven't already created your model bindings, please refer to the [Bingen section](/client/sdk/unity/important-concepts#bingen) for step-by-step instructions on how to do so.

- Import Models: Locate the `bindings/unity/Models` folder within your Dojo project. Simply drag the desired `model` files from this folder into your Unity project. The `Synchronization Master` will automatically detect and load these models for seamless data exchange.

## Calling systems

This section explores the process of interacting with Dojo systems from Unity, which involves these steps: Account creation, contract assembly, and execution.

### Account Creation

We have two options for creating an account: a simple account or a burner account.

#### Simple Account Creation

To create a simple account, follow this code:

```cs
using Dojo;
using Dojo.Starknet;
using UnityEngine;

void Start()
{
    var provider = new JsonRpcClient(dojoConfig.rpcUrl);
    var signer = new SigningKey(masterPrivateKey);
    var account = new Account(provider, signer, new FieldElement(masterAddress));
}
```

#### Burner Account Creation

For a burner account, execute the following code:

```cs
using Dojo;
using Dojo.Starknet;
using UnityEngine;

async void Start()
{
    Account burnerAccount = await CreateBurnerAccount(dojoConfig.rpcUrl, masterAddress, masterPrivateKey);
}

private async Task<Account> CreateBurnerAccount(string rpcUrl, string masterAddress, string masterPrivateKey )
{
    var provider = new JsonRpcClient(rpcUrl);
    var signer = new SigningKey(masterPrivateKey);
    var account = new Account(provider, signer, new FieldElement(masterAddress));

    BurnerManager burnerManager = new BurnerManager(provider, account);
    return await burnerManager.DeployBurner();
}
```

> Replace `masterAddress` and `masterPrivateKey` with the **account Address** and **private key** of the prefunded Katana account.
> ![bindings-example](/unity/prefunded-account-address.png)

### Contract assembly and execution

The [Bingen plugin](/client/sdk/unity/important-concepts#bingen) also generates bindings for contracts. Therefore, the first step is to move these bindings into your Unity project.

Let's consider a contract named PlayerSystem within our Dojo project:

```rust
#[starknet::interface]
trait IPlayerSystem<TContractState> {
    fn create(
        ref self: TContractState, player: ContractAddress, player_name: felt252, gender_id: u64
    );
}
```

The generated bindings would be as follows:

```cs
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Dojo;
using Dojo.Starknet;
using UnityEngine;
using dojo_bindings;

public class Player_system : MonoBehaviour {
    // The address of this contract
    public string contractAddress;

    // Call the `create` system with the specified Account and calldata
    // Returns the transaction hash. Use `WaitForTransaction` to wait for the transaction to be confirmed.
    public async Task<FieldElement> Create(Account account, FieldElement player, string player_name, ulong gender_id) {
        return await account.ExecuteRaw(new dojo.Call[] {
            new dojo.Call{
                to = contractAddress,
                selector = "create",
                calldata = new dojo.FieldElement[] {
                    new FieldElement(player.Hex()).Inner(),
                    new FieldElement(player_name).Inner(),
                    new FieldElement(gender_id.ToString('X')).Inner()
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

Let's break down the concepts:

- `public string contractAddress;`: This indicates the contract address of the `Player_system`, obtained as output from `sozo migrate`.
- `new dojo.Call{ ... }`: This section creates a new call, where the `selector` is the name of the system to call, and the `calldata` represents the parameters. It's crucial to note that strings, uints and ulongs must be converted into hexadecimal representation.
- `account.ExecuteRaw(new dojo.Call[] { ... })`: This method executes the call, where `account` can be either a simple account or a burner account.

> It's possible to execute an array of calls simultaneously by passing multiple calls to this method. For example:

```cs
public async Task<FieldElement> ExecuteCalls(Account account, dojo.Call[] calls)
{
    return await account.ExecuteRaw(calls);
}
```

## Building your Dojo Game

The final stage is building your onchain game for deployment. Dojo currently supports building for both _desktop_ and _WebGL_ platforms.

### Building for Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)

- Navigate to `File/Build Settings`.
- From the right menu choose `Windows, Mac, Linux` option.
- From the Platform dropdown, select the target desktop platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux) based on your needs.
- Click the Build button to initiate the build process.

### Building for WebGL

> Ensure the WebGL module is installed for your current Unity version. If not:

- Open the `Unity Hub`.
- Go to `Installs`.
- Select the Unity version matching your project.
- Click `Add Modules`.
- Under the Modules tab, locate and install the `WebGL` module.

![unityhub-add-module](/unity/webgl-module.png)

> Configure WebGL Player Settings:

- Go to `Edit/Project Settings/Player` (or navigate directly using the Project Settings window).
- Select the `WebGL` tab.
- Under `Resolution and Presentation`, ensure the `Dojo Template` is selected.
