# 0. Initial Setting

_Before you start, I recommend you to follow `hello-dojo` chaper to get brief understanding of dojo game._

Check if you already installed `sozo`. (If not, check out installation [page](../../getting-started/installation.md) )

## sozo init

Open your empty game folder and open terminal.

```sh
sozo init
```

You will see basic `dojo-starter` folder structure that have example components and systems inside.

```sh
 ‚õ©Ô∏è ====== STARTING ====== ‚õ©Ô∏è

Setting up project directory tree...
Cloning project template from https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo-starter...

üéâ Successfully created a new ‚õ©Ô∏è Dojo project!

====== SETUP COMPLETE! ======


To start using your new project, try running: `sozo build`
```

Congratulations! Now you have a basic set up for a chess game :) Starting from the next chapter you will implement a small component. Move on to the next chapter!
