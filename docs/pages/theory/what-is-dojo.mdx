# Dojo; Simplifying Onchain Game Development

Building games is hard enough, but building games onchain is even harder. Dojo simplifies the process of building onchain games by providing a suite of tools that streamline the process of building onchain games, allowing developers to focus on gameplay logic and drastically reducing time-to-game.

## Cairo State and Contract Framework

- Dojo extends Cairo's base functionality and adds helpful inline `macros`
- Simplifies interoperability with the dojo Models
- Standardized approach to building games on cairo smart contracts
- Simplifies development process allowing you to focus on logic and not architecture


The following is an example of a dojo function and contains the macros `get!` and `set!` which are used to read and write to the world state.

```rust
fn spawn(self: @ContractState) {
    // Access the world dispatcher for reading.
    let world = self.world_dispatcher.read();

    // Get the address of the current caller, possibly the player's address.
    let player = get_caller_address();

    // Retrieve the player's current position from the world.
    let position = get!(world, player, (Position));

    // Retrieve the player's move data, e.g., how many moves they have left.
    let moves = get!(world, player, (Moves));

    // Update the world state with the new data.
    // 1. Set players moves to 10
    // 2. Move the player's position 100 units in both the x and y direction.
    set!(
        world,
        (
            Moves { player, remaining: 100, last_direction: Direction::None },
            Position { player, vec: Vec2 { x: 10, y: 10 } },
        )
    );
}

```

### What dojo is not

Dojo does not provide visual graphics, but integrates with engines like Unreal, Godot, or Unity. However, dojo SDKs exist to integrate with these visual engines.
