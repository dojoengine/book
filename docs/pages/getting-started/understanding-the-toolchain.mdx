# Understanding the Toolchain

Now that you've built your first Dojo app, let's explore the tools that made it possible.
Understanding each tool's role will help you develop more effectively and debug issues when they arise.

## Katana: Your Local Starknet

**What it is**: Katana is a high-performance Starknet sequencer designed for development.

**What it does**:

- Provides a local blockchain environment
- Mines blocks instantly for fast development
- Comes with pre-funded accounts for testing
- Supports gRPC for faster network communication

### Key Features

When you run `katana --dev`, you get:

### Development vs Production

**Development mode** (`--dev`):

- Instant block mining
- Pre-funded accounts
- No fees or account validation

**Production mode**:

- Configurable mining intervals
- Can fork existing chains
- Can persist state to a database

### Katana Configuration

Customize Katana's behavior:

```bash
# Start in development mode without fees
katana --dev --dev.no-fee

# Automatically deploy the Controller contract
katana --cartridge.controllers

# Fork off of a specific chain & block
katana --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --fork-block-number <BLOCK_NUM>
```

## Torii: Your Data Layer

**What it is**: Torii is an automatic indexing engine that makes your World's data easily queryable.

**What it does**:

- Introspects and monitors all events from your World
- Builds a searchable database of application state
- Provides flexible GraphQL and gRPC APIs
- Enables real-time client subscriptions

### How Torii Works

1. **Event Listening**: Monitors your World for state changes
2. **Data Processing**: Converts Cairo events into structured data
3. **Database Storage**: Maintains a SQL database of current state
4. **API Generation**: Automatically creates GraphQL schemas
5. **Real-time Updates**: Pushes changes to connected clients

### Using Torii's APIs

After starting `torii --world <WORLD_ADDRESS>`, you can access data through multiple interfaces.
Let's make a query to retrieve all the instances of the `Position` model.

#### GraphiQL (Browser)

Visit `http://localhost:8080/graphql` for an interactive query interface:

```graphql
query {
    diPositionModels {
        edges {
            node {
                player
                x
                y
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### GraphQL (Programmatic)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ diPositionModels { edges { node { player x y } } } }"}'
```

:::tip
You can learn more about GraphQL [here](https://graphql.org/learn).
:::

#### gRPC

For high-performance applications, use the gRPC endpoint at `localhost:8080`.

### Torii Configuration

Customize Torii's behavior:

```bash
# Set the RPC endpoint to index (default localhost:5050)
torii --rpc <RPC_ENDPOINT>

# Path to persistent storage (recommended for production)
torii --db-dir torii.db

# Enable CORS for local development
torii --http.cors_origins "*"
```

## Sozo: Your Command Center

**What it is**: Sozo is the command-line interface for managing Dojo projects.

**What it does**:

- Initializes new projects
- Compiles Cairo code
- Deploys contracts
- Manages World interactions
- Handles authorization

### Project Lifecycle with Sozo

#### 1: Project Creation

```bash
# Clone the template into the my-game directory
sozo init my-game --template dojoengine/dojo-starter (default)
```

#### 2. Development

```bash
# Compile your code (defaults to dev profile)
sozo build

# Compile your code with a different profile
sozo build --profile staging

# Run tests
sozo test

# Clean build artifacts
sozo clean
```

:::info
To build new profiles, add `[profile.<PROFILE>]` to your project's `Scarb.toml`.
:::

#### 3. Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to local Katana (defaults to dev profile)
sozo migrate

# Deploy to a staging environment
sozo migrate --profile staging

# Deploy to a production environment
sozo migrate --profile mainnet
```

:::info
To define new profiles, create a `dojo_<PROFILE>.toml` file in your contract directory.
:::

:::warning
You **must** have a `dojo_dev.toml` file in your contract directory, or Sozo will complain.
:::

After migrating, Sozo will generate a `manifest_<PROFILE>.json` file, which contains information about the deployed contracts and interfaces.
Thsi file is meant to be consumed by clients to help them interact with the world.

#### 4. Interaction

```bash
# Execute a system (note the namespacing)
sozo execute di-actions spawn

# Query historical events
sozo events

# Query model data (get keys from events)
sozo model get Position <KEY>
```

### Sozo Profiles

Manage different deployment environments with profiles:

```
contracts/
├── dojo_dev.toml
├── dojo_staging.toml
├── Scarb.toml
└── ...
```

Each profile defines basic data for a deployment:

```toml
[world]
name = "Dojo intro"
description = "A simple intro to Dojo."
seed = "123" # Changes the World address

[namespace]
default = "di" # Default namespace for the world

[env]
rpc_url = "http://localhost:5050/" # Katana instance
account_address = "0x127f..." # Deployer address
private_key = "0xc5b2..." # Deployer private key
world_address = "0x04d9..." # For previously deployed worlds

[writers]
"di" = ["di-actions"] # target = grantee
```

See [this page](/framework/config) for more information about Sozo profiles.

## Saya: Your Proof Generator

**What it is**: Saya generates cryptographic proofs of your World's execution.

**What it does**:

- Creates STARK proofs of game state transitions
- Enables provable gaming and autonomous worlds
- Supports different proving backends
- Handles proof verification and settlement

:::tip
You **do not** need Saya for basic Dojo development.
:::

### When You Need Saya

Saya becomes important when you want:

- **Provable fairness**: Public guarantees of correct execution
- **L1 settlement**: Settle state changes on Ethereum or other chains
- **Competition integrity**: Tamper-proof tournaments and rankings

For more information about Saya, [see the docs](/toolchain/saya).

## How The Toolchain Works Together

Here's the typical development flow:

1. **Sozo** compiles your Cairo code into deployable contracts
2. **Katana** provides a local blockchain to deploy and test on
3. **Sozo** deploys your World contract to Katana
4. **Torii** automatically indexes your World's data
6. **Saya** (optionally) generates proofs for settlement

## Tool Configuration

Each tool can be configured through various methods:

### Configuration Priority (highest to lowest)

1. Command-line flags
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration files
4. Default values

### Common Configuration Files

- `dojo_dev.toml`: Sozo project and World settings
- `torii_dev.toml`: Torii indexing and World settings
- `katana.toml`: Katana network configuration settings

## Development Best Practices

### Keep Tools Running

During development, keep all tools running in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1
katana --config katana.toml

# Terminal 2
torii --config torii_dev.toml

# Terminal 3
# Your sozo commands
```

### Use Profiles

Set up different profiles for different environments:

```bash
# Development
sozo execute di-actions spawn

# Testing on staging
sozo execute di-actions spawn --profile staging
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Katana Won't Start

- Check if port 5050 is already in use
- Try a different port: `katana --dev --port 5051`

### Torii Can't Connect

- Ensure Katana is running first
- Verify the World address is correct
- Check network connectivity

### Sozo Commands Fail

- Verify you're in a Dojo project directory
- Check your profile configuration
- Ensure sufficient account balance

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the toolchain, you're ready to learn about the [development workflow](/getting-started/development-workflow) and start building more complex applications.

Each tool has extensive documentation in the toolchain section for when you need to dive deeper into specific features and configurations.
