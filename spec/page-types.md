# Documentation Page Types: The Diátaxis Framework

This guide defines how we structure our documentation using the **Diátaxis framework**, a systematic approach that divides technical documentation into four distinct types, each serving different user needs and contexts.

## Why Diátaxis?

The Diátaxis framework recognizes that users approach documentation with different needs:

- **I want to learn** → Tutorial
- **I want to achieve a specific goal** → How-to Guide
- **I need to look something up** → Reference
- **I want to understand** → Explanation

By clearly separating these purposes, we create documentation that serves users effectively regardless of their current context or experience level.

## The Four Documentation Types

```text
                  LEARNING-ORIENTED  |  GOAL-ORIENTED
                                     |
    PRACTICAL         Tutorials      |   How-to Guides
                                     |
                 ------------------- + -------------------
                                     |
    THEORETICAL    Explanations      |   Reference
                                     |
              UNDERSTANDING-ORIENTED | INFORMATION-ORIENTED
```

### When to Use Each Type

| Type             | User's Question                | User's Context                            | Content Focus                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Tutorial**     | "Can you teach me?"            | New to the topic, wants to learn by doing | Step-by-step learning journey |
| **How-to Guide** | "How do I solve this problem?" | Has specific goal, knows basics           | Task completion               |
| **Reference**    | "What are the details?"        | Needs precise information quickly         | Facts and specifications      |
| **Explanation**  | "Why does this work this way?" | Wants deeper understanding                | Concepts and design reasoning |

## Choosing the Right Type

When creating new documentation, ask yourself:

1. **What is the user trying to accomplish?**

    - Learn something new → Tutorial
    - Solve a specific problem → How-to Guide
    - Look up information → Reference
    - Understand concepts → Explanation

2. **What is the user's experience level?**

    - Beginner wanting to learn → Tutorial
    - Experienced with a specific goal → How-to Guide
    - Any level needing facts → Reference
    - Any level wanting understanding → Explanation

3. **What type of content are you writing?**
    - Step-by-step learning → Tutorial
    - Problem-solving steps → How-to Guide
    - Facts and specifications → Reference
    - Concepts and reasoning → Explanation

## Cross-References Between Types

Effective documentation links between types appropriately:

- **Tutorials** should link to **Explanations** for concepts and **Reference** docs for commands used
- **How-to Guides** should link to **Reference** docs for detailed specifications and **Tutorials** for learning prerequisites
- **Reference** docs should link to **How-to Guides** for usage examples and **Explanations** for conceptual context
- **Explanations** should link to **Tutorials** for hands-on learning and **Reference** docs for implementation details

This creates a cohesive documentation ecosystem where users can easily navigate between different types of information as their needs change.
