## Systems

> **IMPORTANT:** Before defining your systems, prioritize permissions. Plan carefully to ensure proper access and security.

**_TL;DR_**

- Systems function as contract methods.
- Contracts containing Systems gain permissions to write to models.
- Systems pass a `world` address as their first parameter unless utilizing the [`#[dojo::contract]`](#the-dojocontract-decorator) decorator.
- Systems engage the world contract to alter models' state.
- The world contract is invoked through systems.
- Systems ought to be concise and specific.
- In most scenarios, systems are stateless.

### What are Systems?

Within dojo we define systems as functions within a Dojo Contract that act on the world.

Systems play a pivotal role in your world's logic, directly mutating its component states. It's important to understand that to enact these mutations, a system needs explicit permission from the [`models`](/cairo/models.md) owner.

### System Permissions

Since the whole contract is given write access to the model, it is important to be careful when defining systems. A simple way to think about it is:

![System Permissions](/permissions.png)

### System Structure

Every system function starts with a [`world`](/cairo/world.md) address as its initial parameter. This design permits these functions to alter the world's state. Notably, this structure also makes systems adaptable and reusable across multiple worlds!

Let's look at the simplest possible system which mutates the state of the `Moves` component.

> NOTE: This is not using the #[dojo::contract] attribute meaning it was to accept the world as a parameter.

```rust
#[starknet::contract]
mod player_actions {
    use starknet::{ContractAddress, get_caller_address};
    use dojo::world::{IWorldDispatcher, IWorldDispatcherTrait};
    use dojo_examples::components::{Position, Moves, Direction, Vec2};
    use dojo_examples::utils::next_position;
    use super::IPlayerActions;

    // no storage
    #[storage]
    struct Storage {}

    // implementation of the PlayerActions interface
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl PlayerActionsImpl of IPlayerActions<ContractState> {
        fn spawn(world: IWorldDispatcher) {
            let player = get_caller_address();
            let position = get!(world, player, (Position));
            set!(
                world,
                (
                    Moves {
                        player,
                        remaining: 10,
                        last_direction: Direction::None(())
                    }
                )
            );
        }
    }
}
```

## Breaking it down

#### System is a function in a contract

As you can see a System is like a regular function of a Starknet contract. This contract can include storage, and it can implement interfaces.

#### `Spawn` function

The spawn function is currently the only system that exists in this contract. It is called when a player spawns into the world. It is responsible for setting up the player's initial state.

### The `#[dojo::contract]` Decorator

All Starknet contracts are defined using the `#[starknet::contract]` decorator, ensuring accurate compilation. In this context, Dojo introduces the `#[dojo::contract]` decorator, which aims to minimize boilerplate in contract writing.

The `#[dojo::contract]` decorator allows developers to omit including `world: IWorldDispatcher` as a parameter. Behind the scenes, it injects the world into the contract and eliminates some imports, thereby streamlining the development process.

```rust
#[dojo::contract]
mod player_actions {
    use starknet::{ContractAddress, get_caller_address};
    use dojo_examples::models::{Position, Moves, Direction, Vec2};
    use dojo_examples::utils::next_position;
    use super::IPlayerActions;

    #[event]
    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    enum Event {
        Moved: Moved,
    }

    #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
    struct Moved {
        player: ContractAddress,
        direction: Direction
    }

    // impl: implement functions specified in trait
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl PlayerActionsImpl of IPlayerActions<ContractState> {
        // ContractState is defined by system decorator expansion
        fn spawn(world: IWorldDispatcher) {
            // player
            let player = get_caller_address();

            // get the position
            let position = get!(world, player, (Position));

            // set the position
            set!(
                world,
                (
                    Moves { player, remaining: 10, last_direction: Direction::None(()) },
                    Position { player, vec: Vec2 { x: 10, y: 10 } },
                )
            );
        }

        fn move(world: IWorldDispatcher, direction: Direction) {
            // player
            let player = get_caller_address();

            // get the position and moves
            let (mut position, mut moves) = get!(world, player, (Position, Moves));

            // adjust
            moves.remaining -= 1;
            moves.last_direction = direction;

            // get next direction
            let next = next_position(position, direction);

            // set models
            set!(world, (moves, next));

            // emit custom event
            emit!(world, Moved { player, direction });
        }
    }
}
```
