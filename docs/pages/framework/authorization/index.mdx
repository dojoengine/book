# Authorization of Models

A key feature of Dojo is the ability to authorize access to the world state. This is done via the `writers` config in the `dojo_dev.toml` or `dojo_release.toml` file.

## How it works?

Let's say we have the following setup:

`actions.cairo` - This is the file where we define our contract with functions


Then we define a model...

```rust
#[derive(Drop, Serde, Debug)]
#[dojo::model]
pub struct DirectionsAvailable {
    #[key]
    pub player: ContractAddress,
    pub directions: Array<Direction>,
}
```

Now we need to define the writers in our `dojo_dev.toml` or `dojo_release.toml` file.

```toml
# ... other config

[writers]
# This means that any model in the `dojo_starter` namespace can only be written to by the `dojo_starter-actions` contract.
"dojo_starter" = ["dojo_starter-actions"] 

# More specific fine-grained authorization 
# This means that only the `dojo_starter-DirectionsAvailable` model can be written to by the `dojo_starter-actions` contract.
"dojo_starter-DirectionsAvailable" = ["dojo_starter-actions"]
```

### In Testing

In your testing files you can bypass authorization in the world by using the `write_model_test`.

```rust
// write like you normally would
world.write_model_test(@position);
```
