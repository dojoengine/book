# Installing Dojo

Dojo's installation process was designed to be idiomatically consistent with its dependencies, Rust and Cairo.
You can get up-and-running in just a few steps, and be building provable games in no time.

:::warning
**Windows Users**: Windows is not natively supported. We recommend [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for Windows development.
:::

## Quick Start

For existing Cairo developers, the fastest way to get started is with `asdf`:

```bash
# Install the asdf plugins
asdf plugin add sozo https://github.com/dojoengine/asdf-sozo.git
asdf plugin add katana https://github.com/dojoengine/asdf-katana.git
asdf plugin add torii https://github.com/dojoengine/asdf-torii.git

# Install the Dojo toolchain
asdf install sozo latest
asdf install katana latest
asdf install torii latest
```

:::note
Follow the `asdf` [installation instructions](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) for your platform, if not already installed.
:::

This will install all necessary dependencies and tools. Skip to [Verification](#verification) to test your installation.

## Detailed Installation

### System Requirements

Before installing Dojo, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2
- **Memory**: At least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 2GB free disk space for toolchains and dependencies
- **Network**: Stable internet connection for downloading binaries
- **Dependencies**: `curl`, `jq`, and `git` (usually pre-installed on most systems)

## Prerequisites

Before installing Dojo, you'll need these foundational tools:

#### 1. Install Rust with `rustup`

Rust is required for Dojo's infrastructure tools (Katana and Torii).

**Minimum version**: 1.85.0

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

This installs Rust's executables, including the [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) package manager, in the `~/.cargo` directory.

**Verify installation:**
```bash
cargo --version
# Should output: cargo 1.85.0 (or later)
```

For more information, see the [Rust installation guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

#### 2. Install Cairo with `starkup`

Dojo is written in [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/), StarkWare's language for creating provable programs.

**Minimum version**: 2.10.1

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.sh | sh
```

This installs Cairo's toolchain, including the [`scarb`](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) package manager and build tool, in the `~/.asdf` directory.

> **Note**: `asdf` does not automatically add itself to your path. Consider appending `~/.asdf/shims` to your terminal's `$PATH` variable to simplify development.

**Verify installation:**
```bash
scarb --version
# Should output: scarb 2.10.1 (or later)
```

For more information, see the [starkup documentation](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup).

## Installing Dojo

The Dojo framework consists of a Cairo framework and three Rust-based tools: `katana`, `torii`, and `sozo`.

:::note
The Cairo framework is downloaded as a compile-time dependency using Scarb, not through a version manager.
:::

### Installing with `asdf`

[`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) is currently the preferred way to install Dojo.
`asdf` is a popular version manager, enabling easy programmatic installation of dependencies through the `.tool-versions` file.

::::steps

#### Install asdf

Follow the [asdf installation instructions](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) for your platform, if not already installed.

#### Add the asdf plugins

```bash
asdf plugin add katana https://github.com/dojoengine/asdf-katana.git
asdf plugin add torii https://github.com/dojoengine/asdf-torii.git
asdf plugin add sozo https://github.com/dojoengine/asdf-sozo.git
```

#### Install the Dojo toolchain

```bash
# Install the latest version
asdf install {sozo,katana,torii} latest

# Install specific versions
asdf install {sozo,katana,torii} 1.6.0

# List available versions
asdf list all {sozo,katana,torii}
```

#### Set the version

```bash
# Set version locally (in project .tool-versions)
asdf set {sozo,katana,torii} latest

# Set version globally (in user home .tool-versions)
asdf set --home {sozo,katana,torii} latest
```

:::tip
Once dependency versions are saved in `.tool-versions`, you can install all dependencies by running `asdf install` in the project root.

### Installing with `dojoup`

[`dojoup`](https://install.dojoengine.org) is an alternative way to install and manage Dojo installations.
Dojoup is version-aware and will automatically install compatible versions of `katana`, `torii`, and `sozo`.

::::steps

#### Install `dojoup`

```bash
curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash
```

This command installs `dojoup` in the `~/.dojo` directory and adds it to your shell profile.

:::info
You need to restart your terminal for the `dojoup` command to be available.
:::

#### Install the Dojo toolchain

In a new terminal window, run:

```bash
dojoup install
```

This installs `katana`, `torii`, and `sozo` in the `~/.dojo` directory.

#### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Install a specific version
dojoup install 1.6.0

# Get help
dojoup --help
```

::::

## Verification

After installation, verify that all tools are working correctly:

### Check Dojo Tools

```bash
# Check Sozo (CLI tool)
sozo --version
# Should output: sozo 1.6.0 (or later)

# Check Katana (sequencer)
katana --version
# Should output: katana 1.6.0 (or later)

# Check Torii (indexer)
torii --version
# Should output: torii 1.6.0 (or later)
```

### Test Your Installation

Create a simple test project to verify everything works:

```bash
# Clone the dojo-starter repository
git clone https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo-starter

# Navigate to the project
cd dojo-starter

# Build the project
sozo build

# Test successful if no errors appear
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

#### `dojoup: command not found`

**Problem**: After installing dojoup, the command is not found.

**Solution**:

1. Restart your terminal completely
2. If still not working, manually source the environment: `source ~/.dojo/env`
3. Check that `~/.dojo/bin` is in your PATH: `echo $PATH | grep -o ~/.dojo`

#### `starkup` installation fails

**Problem**: `starkup` fails to install or configure properly.

**Solution**:

1. Ensure `asdf` is properly installed
2. Add `~/.asdf/shims` to your PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.asdf/shims:$PATH"`
3. Or, add it via your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.)

#### Version compatibility issues

**Problem**: Incompatible versions between Rust, Cairo, or Dojo components.

**Solution**:

1. Check current versions:
   ```bash
   cargo --version    # Should be 1.85.0+
   scarb --version    # Should be 2.10.1+
   sozo --version     # Should be 1.6.0+
   ```

2. Update if needed:
   ```bash
   rustup update              # Update Rust
   asdf install scarb latest  # Update Cairo/Scarb
   dojoup install             # Update Dojo
   ```

#### Build failures in test project

**Problem**: `sozo build` fails in the test project.

**Solution**:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Try cleaning and rebuilding: `sozo clean && sozo build`

3. Check for [version mismatches](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo/blob/main/versions.json) between your installed tools
