# Dojo: The provable game engine

## Simplifing onchain apps

Dojo is an [open source](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo) framework for building **provable** Games, Autonomous Worlds and other Applications that are composable, extensible, permissionless and persistent.

We designed Dojo to be the best platform for building any type of onchain application. Specialized for game development, yet perfect for all onchain applications.

In three steps, you can ship a best-in-class onchain app:

1. Define your onchain state with familar model structure to a db
2. Query your state via autogenerated GraphQL or gRPC
3. Ship it

No more writing indexers, no convoluted contract patterns, and no complicated query systems.

Build whatever you envision in a fraction of the time.

## Whats in the box?

**Dojo** is designed to significantly reduce the complexity of developing provable and onchain applications that can be deployed to and verified by blockchains. It does so by providing a ~zero-cost abstraction for developers to succinctly define provable applications using [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/) and a robust toolchain for building, migrating, deploying, proving and settling these worlds in production.

Dojo includes:

- [Framework](framework): a set of contracts and a protocol for building applications that are natively provable, extensible and composable.
- [Katana](toolchain/katana): a modular and extensible sequencer designed for high performance applications.
- [Torii](toolchain/torii): an indexer exposing an automatically generated GraphQL and gRPC api for real-time state synchronization.
- [Sozo](toolchain/sozo): a declarative migration planning tool for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining smart contracts.

In addition, [Cartridge](https://cartridge.gg) provides tools and services for productionalizing provable applications:

- [Slot](toolchain/slot): a managed infrastructure service for deploying and scaling provable applications in seconds.

:::note
Before diving into the Dojo book, if you are new to cairo we highly recommend you to [learn Cairo](https://book.cairo-lang.org) first.
