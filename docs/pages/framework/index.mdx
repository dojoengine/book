# Dojo Framework Overview

:::note

Dojo is built on top of Cairo. We suggest [familiarizing yourself with Cairo](https://book.cairo-lang.org/) before using Dojo.
:::

## What is Dojo?

Dojo is a comprehensive framework for building provable games and autonomous worlds on Starknet. It combines the power of Cairo smart contracts with Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture to create scalable, composable onchain applications.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Provable**: All game logic and state changes are verifiable onchain
- **Composable**: Modular design allows for easy extension and integration
- **Scalable**: Optimized for high-performance onchain applications
- **Developer-friendly**: Rich tooling and familiar development patterns

## Understanding ECS Architecture

[Entity-Component-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) (ECS) is a design pattern that separates data from logic, enabling highly modular and scalable applications.

**The Problem ECS Solves:**
Traditional object-oriented programming can lead to complex inheritance hierarchies and tight coupling between data and behavior. ECS addresses these issues by decomposing your application into three distinct parts:

### The ECS Trinity

```

-   **Entities**: The *objects* in your game — characters, items, etc.
-   **Components**: The *properties* of your entities — position, durability, etc.
-   **Systems**: The *rules* that govern your game — movement, combat, etc.

With ECS, you assign **components** to **entities**, and operate on them using **systems**.
This approach allows for a more modular and scalable design, as well as better performance and memory usage.
Entities are typically represented as a unique identifier, to which components are assigned.
Systems can then operate over large numbers of entities at once, depending on the components they have.

As an example, a combat system might reduce the durability of all weapons used in a battle, while a rest system might increase the health of all members of a party.

**ECS Benefits:**
- **Modularity**: Components can be mixed and matched across entity types
- **Performance**: Systems can efficiently process large numbers of entities
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new components or systems without affecting existing code

### Real-World Example

Consider a simple RPG where both players and monsters can move and fight:

```rust
// Components (Data)
#[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde)]
#[dojo::model]
struct Position {
    #[key]
    entity_id: u32,
    x: u32,
    y: u32,
}

#[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde)]
#[dojo::model]
struct Health {
    #[key]
    entity_id: u32,
    hp: u32,
    max_hp: u32,
}

// Systems (Logic)
#[starknet::interface]
trait IGameSystem<T> {
    fn move(ref self: T, entity_id: u32, direction: Direction);
    fn fight(ref self: T, attacker_id: u32, target_id: u32);
}

#[dojo::contract]
mod game_system {
    use super::{Position, Health, Direction, IGameSystem};
    use dojo::model::{ModelStorage};
    use dojo::world::{WorldStorage, WorldStorageTrait};

    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl GameSystemImpl of IGameSystem<ContractState> {
        fn move(ref self: ContractState, entity_id: u32, direction: Direction) {
            let mut world = self.world(@"my_game");
            let mut position: Position = world.read_model(entity_id);

            // Update position based on direction

            world.write_model(@position);
        }

        fn fight(ref self: ContractState, attacker_id: u32, target_id: u32) {
            let mut world = self.world(@"my_game");
            let mut attacker_health: Health = world.read_model(attacker_id);
            let mut target_health: Health = world.read_model(target_id);

            // Handle combat logic

            world.write_model(@target_health);
        }
    }
}
```

Both player and monsters can have Position and Health components, and the same systems work for both.

## Dojo's ECS Implementation

Dojo adapts ECS for the onchain environment with three core concepts:

### 1. Models (Components)

Models are Cairo structs that define your application's data structures. They act as *components* in the ECS pattern.

```rust
#[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde)]
#[dojo::model] // Defines a model, used to generate Torii events
struct Position {
    #[key] // Defines a model's key, like an ORM primary key
    pub player: ContractAddress,
    // The rest of the model's attributes
    pub x: u32,
    pub y: u32,
}
```

:::note
`#[dojo::model]` and `#[key]` are examples of [procedural macros](https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch12-10-procedural-macros.html), which tell the Cairo compiler where to add Dojo-specific code.
:::

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic indexing**: All model changes are automatically indexed by Torii
- **Type safety**: Full Cairo type system support
- **Composability**: Models can be reused across different entity types

### 2. Systems (Smart Contracts)

Systems implement your application's business logic as Cairo contract functions.

```rust
// First define the interface
#[starknet::interface]
trait IActions<T> {
    fn move_player(ref self: T, direction: Direction);
}

#[dojo::contract] // Defines a Dojo contract
mod actions {
    use super::IActions;
    use starknet::{ContractAddress, get_caller_address};
    use dojo::model::{ModelStorage};
    use dojo::world::{WorldStorage, WorldStorageTrait};

    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl ActionsImpl of IActions<ContractState> {
        fn move_player(ref self: ContractState, direction: Direction) {
            // Get the world and player entity key
            let mut world = self.world(@"my_game");
            let player = get_caller_address();

            // Read current position
            let mut position: Position = world.read_model(player);

            // Update position based on direction
            match direction {
                Direction::Up => position.y += 1,
                Direction::Down => position.y -= 1,
                Direction::Left => position.x -= 1,
                Direction::Right => position.x += 1,
            }

            // Write updated position
            world.write_model(@position);
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Permissioned access**: Fine-grained control over who can modify what
- **Atomic operations**: All state changes happen in a single transaction
- **Event emission**: Automatic event generation for state changes

### 3. World (Resource Registry)

The World contract serves as the central coordinator, managing all models and systems.

```rust
// The World provides a unified interface for all operations
let mut world = self.world(@"my_game");

// Cairo's typing tells us we are querying the player's position
let position: Position = world.read_model(player_id);

// Update game state
world.write_model(@new_position);

// Emit custom events if needed
world.emit_event(@PlayerMoved { player, direction });
```

**Key Features:**
- **Centralized state**: Single source of truth for all application data
- **Permission management**: Hierarchical authorization system
- **Upgradeability**: Safe model and system upgrades
- **Introspection**: Rich metadata and schema information

## Architecture Overview

![world-map](/shared/world-map.png)

## Development Workflow

1. **Design Models**: Define your data structures as Dojo models
2. **Implement Systems**: Create contract functions that operate on models
3. **Configure Permissions**: Set up authorization for your systems
4. **Deploy to World**: Register your models and systems
5. **Build Client**: Use indexed data to create rich user experiences

## Best Practices

### Model Design
- **Keep models small and focused** - Each model should represent a single concept
- **Design for reusability** - Models should be composable across different entity types
- **Plan for upgrades** - Consider future schema changes when designing models
- **Always derive required traits** - All models must derive `Drop` and `Serde`
- **Use key fields correctly** - All `#[key]` fields must come before non-key fields

### System Design
- **Minimize gas costs** - Batch operations and optimize storage access
- **Handle errors gracefully** - Use assertions and proper error handling
- **Design for permissions** - Group related systems by permission requirements
- **Define interfaces first** - Always create a `#[starknet::interface]` before implementing systems
- **Use proper mutability** - Make world reference mutable when writing models

### Architecture
- **Separate concerns** - Keep data (models) and logic (systems) distinct
- **Use events effectively** - Emit events for important state changes
- **Plan your namespaces** - Organize resources logically and use consistent namespace strings
- **Follow ECS principles** - Compose entities using multiple small, focused models
