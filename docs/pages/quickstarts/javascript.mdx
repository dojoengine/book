### Quickstart with JavaScript

Prerequisites:
- [Dojo CLI installed](/getting-started/installation.md)

1. Create project
```bash
npx @dojoengine/create-dojo start -t example-vite-react-sdk
```

2. Setup client
```bash
cd client
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:5173` to view the project. It will not be connected to the network yet.

3. Setup contracts
```bash
# In contracts directory
sozo build

# In new terminal
katana --disable-fee --allowed-origins "*"
```

4. Connect to the development network and indexer
```bash
sozo migrate apply
```

5. Return to the client and refresh the page. You should now see the project connected to the network and indexed!
