## Deployment to Remote Network

> _IMPORTANT: Dojo is unaudited. Use at your own risk._

Dojo makes it easy to deploy to remote networks, you just need to have a valid account and network endpoint.

Scarb.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "ohayoo"
version = "0.1.0"
cairo-version = "0.6.0"

[cairo]

[dependencies]
dojo = { git = "https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo", tag = "v0.6.0" }

### Deploy to public Starknet

If you credentials are correct in the Scarb.toml then a simple migrate will deploy the world to Starknet.

### Deploy to Remote [Katana](/toolchain/katana)

Katanas are able to be hosted and run as remote testnets, however this is not recommended for production use.
