## sozo auth

`auth` is used to manage world authorization. In the world, authorizations are given on resources, which are identified by a `resource_id`.
In the case of the models, the `resource_id` is the name of the model `struct` you have into your code.
In the case of a dojo contract with systems, the `resource_id` is the address of the contract.
Finally, the world itself is a resource, and its `resource_id` is `0`.

Authorizations are separated in two categories:

-   _Ownership_: when the world / dojo contract is deployed, or a model registered, the deployer becomes the owner of such resource. Ownership can be granted to others.
-   _Writer_: to give write access on models, you must explicitely grant the writer role to a system.

With `sozo auth`, you can grant or revoke ownership or writer roles.

This command sends the transaction to the world contract using a multicall. So independently of the number of resources you want to update, this command will only send one transaction.

### USAGE

```sh
Usage: sozo auth [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  grant   Grant an auth role.
  revoke  Revoke an auth role.
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

The syntax changes depending on the authorization you want to grant / revoke.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- For a model, `model:model_name`.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- For a contract, `contract:0x1234` or `contract:fully::qualified::name`.

-   _`owner_address`_
